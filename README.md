# Prechas
I wrote this project since I didn't want to do English homework about authors.
I wrote everything except for the opcodes since Axon already had the working ones.

# Notice
The code hasn't been tested. The assign C closure works though, didn't have time to test the actual bypass though.
It should work, you can modify it.
